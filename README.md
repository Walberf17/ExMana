New Begin in an old project

Story Line:
  The player Player will begin the game with some questions, asking how it behaves, what it like, where it was born, stuff...
  Then Player will begin the game, in a normal world, living a normal life, with some stats, some background.
  But someday something happened and the world faces a crysis whrere monsters begun to appear!
  The world is changing and this is it, you have to survive.

This is a futuristic RPG with not set storyline, the initial stats are not set, but assigned by the initial questions,
The xp won will be from time in game, xp left by the monsters, and quests or events that give xp.
Batlle and interaction with the word will be similar, Player has a deck, and this deck has habilities like: Walk, smell, try to find, attack, actions.
The time in game is counted in rounds, so after 100 rounds in game (battle and life) you will get 100*(multiplier xp) XP. Player will evolve even if it doesn't fight!

I want it to be a really big and diverse game, with several gameplays!
